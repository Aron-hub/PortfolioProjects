List of project related to Data Sciences

## Covid19
Data source from 'Our World in Data'. Regardless of slowing trend of Covid-19 (although it is still in some places), the purpose of this project is to quickly resume the progress and the impact the we get by this time. By the end of this project, using data exploration, we would get some information about simple question:
- What is the likelihood of dying from Covid-19 cases?
- What is the progress of the number of deaths and cases over an entire location in the world?
- What is the progress of the number of people vaccinated worldwide?
</br>
We also try to use machine learning with time series to predict new cases and deaths using linear regression, trend and seasonality 

## Car Prices
In this project, we would learn how to train a model in order to predict car prices with Machine Learning Using Pytorch.

- Data cleaning using Pandas: sort arrows, remove columns, customization string using function.
- Convert data frame to PyTorch Tensors.
- Creating PyTorch Model to predict car prices.
